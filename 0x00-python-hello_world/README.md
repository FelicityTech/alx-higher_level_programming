2. Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

Use the function print

3. Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.

You can find the source code here
The output of the script should be:
the number, followed by Battery street,

You have to use f-strings

4. Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

You can find the source code here
The output of the program should be:
Float:, followed by the float with only 2 digits
followed by a new line
You are not allowed to cast number to string
You have to use f-strings

5. Complete this source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

You can find the source code here
The output of the program should be:
3 times the value of str
followed by a new line
followed by the 9 first characters of str
followed by a new line
You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement
Your program should be maximum 5 lines long

6. Complete this source code to print Welcome to Holberton School!

You can find the source code here
You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.
You have to use the variables str1 and str2 in your new line of code
Your program should be exactly 5 lines long

7. Complete this source code

You can find the source code here
You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
word_first_3 should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word
word_last_2 should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word
middle_word should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters

8. Complete this source code to print object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line.

You can find the source code here
You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
You are not allowed to create new variables
You are not allowed to use string literals

9. Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.

Your script should be maximum 98 characters long (please check with wc -m 9-easter_egg.py)

10. Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solution’s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle
Requirements:

Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free

11. Write a Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line.

Use the function write from the sys module
You are not allowed to use print
Your script should print to stderr
Your script should exit with the status code 1

12. Write a script that compiles a Python script file.

The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE

The output filename has to be $PYFILEc (ex: export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc)

13. Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode
